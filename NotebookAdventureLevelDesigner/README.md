# NotebookAdventureLevelDesigner (09.04.2022)

This is a level editor for the [NotebookAdventure](https://github.com/NotImplementedLife/NotebookAdventure) GBA game. It's used to edit the map collision and objects data for each level: players position, obstacles, spikes, trampolines etc. The map's visuals were created with Tiled and imported here as images.
